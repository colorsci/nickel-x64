    <String ID="NoteWhyDiskIdle" loc.comment="Explain value of this table in the report">Idle time is a good indicator of disk activity.  Disk subsystems sustain various I/O rates and the Idle counter normalized this data to show when the disk likely to be busy.  The counter value gets smaller as the disk gets busier.</String>
    <String ID="NoteWhyDiskAvg" loc.comment="Explain value of this table in the report">Average seconds per operation is a good indicator of disk activity and health.  An I/O is expected to take under .015 ms on a health disk sub-system.  Values greater than this, especially if the Idle time is high or the disk I/O rate is low, suggest the disk is having trouble reading or writing.  Use any of the suggested Disk diagnostic tests if the later situation exists.</String>
