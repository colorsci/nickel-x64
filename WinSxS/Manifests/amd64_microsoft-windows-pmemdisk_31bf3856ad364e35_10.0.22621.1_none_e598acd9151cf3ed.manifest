Restart your computer.             %n4. When Windows starts again, your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks, even the ones that aren't affected by this problem, so it's important to back up all your data.             %n5. Open the registry editor, navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             %n6. Restart your computer.             %n7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it, you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             %n8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks. You can do that in the elevated PowerShell window by running 'Get-PmemUnusedRegion | New-PmemDisk'. Look at the help content for 'New-PmemDisk' to learn how to specify the disks' atomicity modes." />
